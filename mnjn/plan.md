## Study plans

Initial reading, starting from a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@nandinilreddy/understanding-transformers-llms-3794fe228901)

> Just like how Transformers are foundational models to LLMs; RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, and attention models are foundational models, and each single model contributed to building the Transformer.

1. Check [Ilya 30u30](https://arc.net/folder/84DD0DB7-19AD-4DA5-B0CE-5AA523D3A403) and take a look at papers and blogs that explain RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, and attention models
2. Take a look at transformers
3. Try implementing an LLM project from above
