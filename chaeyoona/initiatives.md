## Motivation

This project aims to explore and document my learning journey with Chaeyoona, focusing on understanding key concepts and practical applications. The main motivations are:

- Reflecting the wins and lessions from the [AI for healthcare](https://github.com/chaeyoona/ai-for-healthcare) participation.
- Building a solid foundation in the subject; LLMs, Generative AI, AI Agents, and Prompt Engineering.
- Documenting learnings and insights for future reference.
- Developing practical examples to optimize use cases for individuals needs.
- Sharing knowledge with the community.

## Initiatives

1. Core Concepts Study
   - Organize a learning plan; what/how to do with the community.
   - Review fundamental principles through reading and watching [videos](../ref/dump.md).
   - Plan what needs to be done to deploy development environment in a forked repository.
   - Complete self-assessments of what level of practice I may try to have on hands-on exercises for next steps.

2. Project Implementation
   - Build a conceptual prompflow what I had presented in the hack day.
   - Create an environment for applications.
   - Document best practices.
   - Test and evaluate the approaches; ground truthness, LLM, and AI Agent.
   - Collect feedback from community members.
